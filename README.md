# Summary

A tool for comparisons of source files (i.e. version control revisions) to
identify which changes create no semantic differences in the program operation.

Use of ast-diff will allow code reviewers or submitters to assure that 
modifications made to improve stylistic formatting of the code, whether
made by hand or using code-formatting tools, does not modify the underlying
*meaning* of the code.
